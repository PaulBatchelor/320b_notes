# Problemset Wordlist 

Scanning through the problemset questions, writing down keywords (to be 
defined later)

Duplicates okay.

pset 1:

FIR: Finite impulse response.
IIR: infinite impulse response.
impulse response: the response of the filter in the time domain
frequency response: the response of the filter in the frequency domain
amplitude response: the magnitude of the frequency response 
phase response: how the filter changes the phase
dc gain: what the filter returns at 0
nyquist limit gain: what the filter returns at nyquest
time delay: 
Linearity: 
Time invariance
Direct Form 1: flow chart for diagraming filter (redundant delays)
Direct Form 2: flow chart for diagram filter (shared delays)
All-pole IIR
Pole-zero IIR

pset 2:

transposed direct form 2
poles: in a transfer function, they are the locations where the denominator is
zero.
zeros: in a transfer function, they are the locations where the numerator is 
zero.
partial fraction expansion: a way to "break out" a Nth order 
closed form expression: an expression that can be evaluated in a finite number
of operations
magnitude frequency response: absolute value of frequency response.
transfer function: expression of filter
dc gain: gain at dc
biquad allpass filter: biquad filter (2 poles, 2 zeros) with coefficients to
make it an allpass filter.
low shelf filter: 
bilinear transform
high shelf filter

pset 3:

analogue low shelf filter
quality factor
complex resonator
digital complex resonator
normalized second order bandpass resonator

pset 4:

group delay 
phase delay
symmetric filter chain
Q: a unitless ratio: resonant frequency / bandwidth 
bandwidth
mininum phase: a filter is minimum phase if the zeros are within the unit
circle
minimum phase/allpass decomposition: a converting a mixed-phase filter into an
allpass filter and a minimum phase filter
Moog VCF: 4 pole lowpass filter

pset 5:
state space: 
difference equation: 
controller canonical form: 
cepstrum: it is the inverse-fft of the log spectrum
bandlimited impulse train: an impulse train that is band limited (won't
alias)?
eigenvalues/vectors
