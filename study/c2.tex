Bilinear transform:
$s = c\frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}$
$z^{-1} = \frac{1 - s/c}{1 + s/c}$ \\
Where $c$ is typically $2/T$. However it can be set arbitrarily to a specific
cutoff frequency as 
$c = w_c \cot(w_c T / 2)$ or
$c = \cot(
\stackrel{\sim}{w}_c T / 2)$ for normalized cutoff frequency 
$\stackrel{\sim}{w}_c = 1$.
