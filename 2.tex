\subsection*{Superpostion}

Superposition: needs linearity and time invariance. aka linear time invariant
systems

\framebox{
\parbox{\textwidth}{
\textit{"seeing the elephant from every angle, 
and 
boy do you know elephants by the end of that"}
}
}\\\\
Linear, time-invariant = LTI

On superposition:\\
\josquote{"ghosts in the room, you see them even 
though they are superimposed in the mixture"}

homogeneity: linear system is additive and homogeneous
