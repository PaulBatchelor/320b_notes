\subsection*{Matlab Demo: Time-Domain filters}
* see timedomain.m *

\josquote{Frequency domain is where it's at.}

TODO: learn about Z-transform... what is it?

Julius invented the first filter coroutine in Matlab.
\\
Julius established the b before a design in Matlab.
\\
Filter by default truncates the output signal, so that's why you zero pad.

Confusion about the organization of the book: REALLY simple introduction.

Next tuesday will be the Z transform: Remember that the Z transform is the DFT generalized.

Laplace transform: Generalized case for the fourier transform (continuous time).

BREAK

Talking about Q... shit I wasn't paying attention, but it's an old thing.

-$-3db$ is a factor of $1/\sqrt{2}$

-$Q = \frac{\omega_0}{2 \pi B} = \frac{f_0}{B}$

-$Q \approx$ number of  cycles

-Helmholtz resonance first resonance in guitars %(I think he said that?)
