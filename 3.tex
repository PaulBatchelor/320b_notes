complex spectral window

every filter can be represented as an impulse response

h is time invariant: does not change over time

nonlienar examples: fail the test of linearity

signal detendant(): look up

Work on using fourier theorems to visualize changes in frequency and time domain

DTFT: similar to DFT (DFT inf), but frequency is continuous (no k in kernel)

how to pull out half the phase of a complex expon

what is G(w) again?
